# revrbe-colorbot

A simple colorbot with trigger and aimbot functionality using BitBlt to capture the colors. 

## Usage

To record colors; simply press INSERT once to start the recording and hold mouse5 to begin recording the colors that are located at the cursors position.   
To exclude colors; simply hold HOME while pressing mouse5 to exclude colors at the cursors position.   

Here is a video, where I showcase it:
